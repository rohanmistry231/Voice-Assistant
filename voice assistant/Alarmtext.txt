Subject: Temporary Work Arrangement: Two Weeks Work from Home

Dear sir/ma'am,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inform you of a temporary adjustment to my work arrangement due to a health issue that has arisen unexpectedly. After consulting with my healthcare provider, it has been advised that I need to work from home for the next two weeks to manage my health effectively.

Unfortunately, I have been diagnosed with liver disease, specifically Hepatitis. While this news comes as a shock, I am committed to following my treatment plan diligently to ensure a speedy recovery. However, this means that I will not be able to physically come into the office during this period.

I want to assure you that despite this setback, I am fully dedicated to maintaining productivity while working remotely. I have already set up my home office to mirror the resources and tools I have at work, and I will be available during regular working hours via email, phone, or any other communication channels necessary.

I understand that my absence may cause some inconvenience, and I sincerely apologize for any disruption. However, I am confident that with your support and understanding, we can navigate through this challenging time smoothly.

I will keep you updated on my progress and any changes to my situation as they arise. In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out to me.

Thank you for your understanding and support during this time.

Warm regards,
Rohan Mistry
